From: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/php@7.1.rb
==> Dependencies
Build: httpd, pkg-config
Required: apr, apr-util, aspell, autoconf, freetds, freetype, gettext, glib, gmp, icu4c, jpeg, libpng, libpq, libtool, libzip, mcrypt, openssl, pcre, unixodbc, webp
==> Caveats
To enable PHP in Apache add the following to httpd.conf and restart Apache:
    LoadModule php7_module /usr/local/opt/php@7.1/lib/httpd/modules/libphp7.so

    <FilesMatch \.php$>
        SetHandler application/x-httpd-php
    </FilesMatch>

Finally, check DirectoryIndex includes index.php
    DirectoryIndex index.php index.html

The php.ini and php-fpm.ini file can be found in:
    /usr/local/etc/php/7.1/

This formula is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because this is an alternate version of another formula.

If you need to have this software first in your PATH run:
  echo 'set -g fish_user_paths "/usr/local/opt/php@7.1/bin" $fish_user_paths' >> ~/.config/fish/config.fish
  echo 'set -g fish_user_paths "/usr/local/opt/php@7.1/sbin" $fish_user_paths' >> ~/.config/fish/config.fish

For compilers to find this software you may need to set:
    LDFLAGS:  -L/usr/local/opt/php@7.1/lib
    CPPFLAGS: -I/usr/local/opt/php@7.1/include


To have launchd start php@7.1 now and restart at login:
  brew services start php@7.1
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
  php-fpm
